        <p>In the 1990s, the digital age was gaining ground and there was a great need for more readable fonts. In response, Microsoft and Mathew Carter worked together to create a masterpiece: Verdana. Their creation not only became the favourite font of the digital market, but also a starting point for digital typography.</p>

        <h2>Revolutionary design for the digital age</h2>
        <p>Verdana is characterised by its conscientious spacing and wide letters, designed in this way to overcome the limitations of computer screens. Its small but legible size made it a favourite for websites and presentations. </p>
        <!-- Quote from Microsoft regarding the VERDANA font -->
        <blockquote cite="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/verdana">
          <p><q>The Verdana fonts exhibit characteristics derived from the pixel rather than the pen, the brush or the chisel. The relationship between straight, curved and diagonal strokes has been painstakingly developed to ensure that the pixel patterns at small sizes are pleasing, clear and legible</q></p>
          <cite>- Microsoft</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <div>
          <p>A sample Verdana font is as follows: <br><em>"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"</em></p>
